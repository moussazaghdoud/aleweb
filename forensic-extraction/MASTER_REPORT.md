## SECTION 4 — Structural Observations & Gaps

### 4.1 Products with pages NOT under /en/products/
- **Rainbow** -> /en/rainbow (standalone section, not under /products/)
- **Rainbow App Connector** -> /en/rainbow/connectors-and-apps/app-connector
- **Rainbow Developers** -> /en/rainbow/developers
- **OmniAccess Stellar Asset Tracking** -> /en/products/asset-tracking (not under a standard category)

### 4.2 Products referenced in solutions but without dedicated product pages
- **OpenTouch Fax Center** (referenced in UC and Collaboration, no standalone /en/products/ page found)
- **4059 Extended Edition Attendant Console** (referenced in Contact Center listings)
- **Soft Panel Manager** (referenced in Applications listings)
- **Visual Notification Assistant** (referenced in Applications listings)
- **OmniAccess Stellar AP1230-Series** (Wi-Fi 5, legacy, may be discontinued)

### 4.3 Duplicate navigation URLs
- "Ecosystems Integration" column points to same URL as "Contact Center and Attendants" (/en/products/applications)
- Security appears under both "Connected Solutions and Devices" AND "IoT Networks"
- VoIP Softphone appears under both "Contact Center" AND "Softphones"

### 4.4 Category naming inconsistencies
- "Communications Management & Security" (/en/products/communications-management-security) — 3 comms-focused products
- "Network Management & Security" (/en/products/network-management-security) — 5 network-focused products
- These are separate categories on the original site but could be confused

### 4.5 Orphan / special pages identified
- /en/rainbow — standalone section outside /en/products/ hierarchy
- /en/partner-locator — standalone tool
- /en/survey — XaaS assessment questionnaire
- /en/sitelinks — sitemap page
- /en/feedback — feedback form
- /en/video-library — standalone video section
- /en/products/user-manuals — documentation portal

### 4.6 Deep structure areas (risk of omission)
- **Transportation:** 5 levels deep (/en/industries/transportation/rail)
- **Education:** 4 levels deep (/en/industries/education/intelligent-campus/safe-and-secure-campus)
- **Business Continuity:** 3 levels deep
- **Partners/DSPP:** 3 levels with external portal links

---

## SECTION 5 — Cross-Reference Validation

### Navigation -> Page inventory check
- All 5 main nav items have corresponding landing pages. PASS
- All 9 industry sections have landing pages. PASS
- All 38 solution pages are accessible. PASS
- All 69 product pages verified. PASS
- All 6 service pages verified. PASS
- All company sub-pages verified. PASS
